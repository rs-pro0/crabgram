This project is in very early development, please don't use it.
# Installation
Because project is in early development it isn't just clone and run, and you need to manualy do some steps.
So for now to make it work, you need to create empty "crabgram.db" file and empty cache directory.
Then using sqlx cli apply photos migration.
Don't forget to clone https://github.com/lonami/grammers inside crabgram directory.
